# Top Investors Analysis

- The script run.py first loads data from csv file and check for data validations. 
- Then the function top_investors identifies unique investments by each investor, 
then counts the number of unique syndicates each investor has invested in.
- It also calculates the total investment amount for each investor. 
- Finally, it merges these two pieces of information and 
selects the top 5 investors based on the number of unique syndicates they have invested in.
